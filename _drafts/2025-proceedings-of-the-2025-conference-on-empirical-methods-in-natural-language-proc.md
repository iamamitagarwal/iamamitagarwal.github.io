**Abstract.** Welcome to EMNLP Industry Track 2025! The EMNLP 2025 Industry Track highlights the key insights, novel research trends and challenges encountered in the design, development and deployment of practical language technology applications. Relevant topics include efficiency, maintainability, and scalability of the real-world, novel use cases, methods, and applications.
The main goal of the Industry Track is to be the foremost venue for bridging the gap and sharing insights between academia and industry. The track made its debut in ACL conferences at the NAACL 2018 and was first introduced to EMNLP in 2022. This year is the fourth edition of the Industry Track at EMNLP. We are thrilled to have received a record 449 submissions to the Industry Track this year, a hundred more submissions than last year. A total of 38 area chairs, out of which 16 with industry affiliations, were recruited to handle the submissions. Each paper underwent review by at least three program committee members, with area chairs providing a meta-review and recommendation. We encouraged an authorreviewer discussion stage for the Industry Track.
