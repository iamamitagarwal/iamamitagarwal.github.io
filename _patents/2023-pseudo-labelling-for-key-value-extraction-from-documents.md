**Abstract.** A computing device may access visually rich documents comprising an image and metadata. A graph, based on the image or metadata, can be generated for a visually rich document. The graph's nodes can correspond to words from the visually rich document. Features for nodes can be determined by the device. The device may generate model labeled graphs by assigning a pseudo-label to nodes using a pretrained model. The device may generate a plurality of graph labeled graphs by assigning a pseudo-label to nodes by matching a first node from a first graph to at least a second node from a second graph. The device may generate a plurality of updated graphs by cross referencing labels from the model labeled graphs and the graph labeled graphs. Until a change in labels is below a threshold, a model can be trained to perform key-value extraction using the updated graphs.
