**Abstract.** Techniques are described herein for generating block extender model. An example method includes a system accessing a base model trained for identifying a base class. The system can access an extender comprising block extenders, the extender class distinct from the base class. The system can connect the extender with the base model to generate an augmented model. The system can input training data to the augmented model, the training data is provided to the base model and the extender, the training data comprising data points associated with the extender class. The system can train the extender model to identify the extender class based at least in part on the training data and the signal received from the base machine learning model. The system can generate a trained extender based at least in part on the training, the extender trained to identify an object associated with the extender class.
