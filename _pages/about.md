Hi - I’m **Amit Agarwal**, a Principal Applied Scientist at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with over a decade of experience turning research into dependable production systems. I work where research meets product: GenAI systems backed by retrieval and ranking, shipped with evaluation and safety you can trust under real traffic. I care about the unglamorous bits as much as the shiny ones - clean data, honest metrics, simpler interfaces, and cost/latency that don’t surprise you at scale. I hold a **Master’s in Machine Learning & AI from Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU)**, and a **PGD in ML & AI from IIIT Bangalore**.

### What I’m focused on
I’m pushing an **evaluation-first** approach to LLM features. Every surface - RAG, NL2SQL, document understanding, multilingual flows-ships with success criteria, targeted human review where it matters, and dashboards that make regressions obvious. On retrieval, I lean on **hybrid search + rerankers** that behave well in the wild, plus guardrails that reduce surprises without blocking velocity. For Document AI, I’ve spent time on **layout-aware models** and **synthetic data** that scale across messy, real-world documents.

### Why it matters
A good system shouldn’t just ace a benchmark once; it should **stay healthy** as products evolve and edge cases appear. That’s why evaluation, robustness, and safety are first-class citizens in my work and why I publish and review: to turn lessons from production into patterns others can reuse.

> 🪂 **Off the clock:** I’m a **certified paraglider** and a **scuba diver**-two very fun ways to practice respecting complexity, preparing well, and staying calm when conditions shift.  
> 🌏 Earlier, I worked with **AIESEC** across India and Thailand; I still enjoy mentoring students and teams building their first real systems.

### Looking ahead
I’m excited about **evaluation-native AI**-systems that surface their confidence and trade-offs by design and about making **multilingual** and **multimodal** experiences feel natural, not bolted on.

If any of this sparks ideas, **say hi** - I’m always up for swapping notes with builders and researchers. You’ll find ways to reach me in the sidebar.
