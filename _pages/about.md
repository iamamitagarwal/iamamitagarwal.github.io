> *“If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more & become more, you are a leader.”* — John Quincy Adams

I’m a **Principal Applied Scientist** at **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**. I build **production** GenAI systems—**LLMs + retrieval/ranking + evaluation & safety**—with a bias toward shipping reliably for enterprise use. Recent work includes **multi-agent RAG/NL2SQL/NL2Code**, layout-aware **Document AI** at scale, and evaluation stacks that combine **automatic metrics + human signals** with CI-friendly dashboards.

### Focus areas
- **Evaluation & safety for LLM features** — rigor, human-in-the-loop, dashboards, bias & robustness.
- **Retrieval & ranking** — hybrid retrieval, rerankers, query understanding, online guardrails.
- **Multimodal & multilingual LLMs** — practical alignment for global, enterprise contexts.
- **Document AI at scale** — key-value extraction, classification, synthetic layout data.
- **Agents & automation** — observable, cost-aware multi-agent workflows (RAG, NL2SQL, NL2Code).

### Now
- Building an **evaluation-first** platform for product teams (clean APIs, CI hooks, human studies).
- Hardening **RAG** systems for multilingual, low-resource, and noisy-OCR settings.

### Highlights
- Led delivery of **multi-agent GenAI** and **Document AI** features across enterprise engagements.
- **Research & IP:** 40+ publications/patents combined; active reviewer/PC for **AAAI, NeurIPS, CVPR, EMNLP, NAACL, IJCAI**.
- **Recognition:** Oracle awards, academic honors, and multiple hackathon wins.
- **Mentorship:** Curriculum and capstone mentorship (Great Learning/MIT/UT Austin cohorts).

### Most-cited & first-author work
- See **Featured** on the [Publications](/publications/) page—auto-curated from first-author entries and top-cited items.
- Every paper links out to **Paper/PDF/Code** where available; tags let you skim by **LLM**, **Retrieval**, **Safety**, **Document-AI**.

### A few fun things
I’m a **certified paraglider** and **scuba diver**. I’ve worked with **AIESEC** across India/Thailand, and I still chase that mix of teamwork, altitude, and new ideas whenever possible.
