I’m Amit Agarwal, a Principal Applied Scientist at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. My work sits where research meets production: building GenAI systems that real users rely on—large language models paired with strong retrieval and ranking, wrapped in evaluation and safety that hold up under enterprise traffic. I like the unglamorous parts as much as the interesting ones: getting data into good shape, making metrics honest, simplifying interfaces so teams can ship faster, and keeping cost and latency in check.

Lately I’ve been pushing an evaluation-first approach to feature development. That means every LLM surface—RAG, NL2SQL, document understanding, multilingual flows—ships with clear success criteria, human-in-the-loop reviews when it matters, and dashboards that make regressions obvious. On the retrieval side, I focus on hybrid retrieval and rerankers that behave well in the wild, plus guardrails that reduce surprises without blocking velocity. For Document AI, I’ve spent time on layout-aware models and synthetic data pipelines that scale across messy, real-world documents.

I care about work that’s dependable, fair, and measurable. A good system shouldn’t just pass a benchmark once; it should stay healthy as products evolve, users change, and edge cases show up. That’s why I’m interested in evaluation and robustness as first-class citizens, not afterthoughts. It’s also why I review and publish: to compare notes with the community and turn lessons from production into practices others can reuse.

Outside work, I’m a certified paraglider and a scuba diver—both great reminders to respect complexity, prepare well, and stay calm when conditions shift. Earlier in my career I worked with AIESEC across India and Thailand, and I still enjoy mentoring students and teams building their first real systems.

If you’re curious about my research and IP, the **Publications** page highlights first-author and highly-cited work and links to papers, PDFs, and code where available. The **Patents** page captures applied ideas that made their way into products. Looking ahead, I’m excited about “evaluation-native” AI—systems that expose their own confidence and tradeoffs—and about making multilingual and multimodal experiences feel natural, not tacked on.
